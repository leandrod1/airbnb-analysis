## Airbnb Analysis

This project entails an exploratory data analytics analysis utilizing Airbnb data from the Lisbon area. The primary objectives are to investigate the following aspects:
- Determine the count of accommodations with at least one day of availability over the past year.
- Identify the geographical areas where these properties are situated.
- Calculate the total earnings in the previous month and their corresponding average.
- Assess the distribution of properties per host and their respective earnings.

The data utilized in this project was sourced from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) and is divided into two parts. The initial step involved employing Python and Jupyter Notebook to extract the CSV data and store it within an SQL database. Subsequently, MySQL was utilized to extract the relevant data of interest, enabling a more focused and detailed analysis.
